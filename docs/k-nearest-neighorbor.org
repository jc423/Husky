** Attributes
+ Supervised Learning
  + Classification - output class membership
  + Regression - average value of knn
+ Non-Parametric
+ Configurability
  + Weight contributions of neighbors by distance
+ Drawbacks
  + Sensitive to local data structure
  + Curse of Dimensionality - problematic when only few features are relevant but distance calculated using several
+ Distance
  + [[file:distances/euclidean-distance.org][Euclidean Distance]]
  + Minkowski Distance
  + Mahalanobis Distance

** Algorithm
*** Weighted K Nearest Neighbor
**** Approach 1
1. Assign weights to features
2. Calculate classification error
3. Adjust weights to account for error
4. Repeat till accurate enough

**** Approach 2
1. Use all features
2. Remove feature and test for improvement
